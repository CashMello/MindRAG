No specific limit is mentioned in the provided context.,A superclass can have multiple direct subclasses. Each subclass has exactly one direct superclass.,"1. We can build a complicated application program from a library of many classes, some of which are related by superclass-subclass relationships, forming an inheritance hierarchy. We draw such hierarchies as follows, with each subclass beneath its superclass (with an arrow pointing to it). While a superclass may have many direct subclasses, a subclass has exactly one direct superclass. So, in this example, the ModularCounter and BoundedCounter classes extend the IntCounter class. Each subclass is in some sense more powerful than the superclass that it extends: it adds more fields and methods. Unfortunately the terms subclass and superclass seem to have exactly the opposite informal meanings. The word super implies something more powerful, but in fact it is the subclass that is more powerful.

In reality, each bus is generally constituted of 50 to 100 distinct physical lines, divided into three subassemblies: The address bus (sometimes called the memory bus) transports memory addresses which the processor wants to access in order to read or write data.

This is consistent across multiple sources provided.,"1. The brain produces roughly 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day, at a rate of about 25mL an hour. This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125-150 mL is present at any one time. Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is produced by the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain.
2. The cerebrospinal fluid is produced at a rate of 500 ml/day. Since the brain can only contain from 135-150 ml, large amounts are drained primarily into the blood throug … h arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus. Thus the CSF turns over about 3.7 times a day.
3. The total volume of CSF in the adult ranges from140 to 270 ml. The volume of the ventricles is about 25 ml. CSF is produced at a rate of 0.2 - 0.7 ml per minute or 600-700 ml per day. The circulation of CSF is aided by the pulsations of the choroid plexus and by the motion of the cilia of ependymal cells. CSF is absorbed across the arachnoid villi into the venous circulation and a significant amount probably also drains into lymphatic vessels around the cranial cavity and spinal canal.
